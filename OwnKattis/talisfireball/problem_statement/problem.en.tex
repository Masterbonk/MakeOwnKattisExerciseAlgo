\problemname{Talis Fireball}

The battle had been raging for many rounds and your party is tired. Things are looking dark, until the wizard Talis realizes he has a 3rd level spell slot left. 
That's enough for a Fireball! But while Talis is searching his scrolls, an arrow grazes his glases. They fall to the groud and shatter into pieces. Now you all need
to work together to fuÃ­nd out how many people Talis can hit. 

Your team will shout the amount of enemies and their coordinates to you. Then they will also shout their location, just so Talis doesn't hit them. Now it is up to you to find out how many enemies Talis can hit with one fireball. Once you tell him the max amount of enemies he can hit, Talis will use his wizard energy to feel where
the fireball should hit on the battlefield. 

In short, you need to calculate the maximum aount of enemies Tails can hit with one Fireball.
