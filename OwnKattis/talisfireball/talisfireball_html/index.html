      <h1>Talis Fireball</h1>
      <h3>Problem ID: talisfireball</h3>
    </div>
    <p>The battle had been raging for many rounds and your party is
    tired. Things are looking dark, until the wizard Talis realizes
    he has a 3rd level spell slot left. That’s enough for a
    Fireball! But while Talis is searching his scrolls, an arrow
    grazes his glases. They fall to the groud and shatter into
    pieces. Now you all need to work together to fuínd out how many
    people Talis can hit.</p>
    <p>Your team will shout the amount of enemies and their
    coordinates to you. Then they will also shout their location,
    just so Talis doesn’t hit them. Now it is up to you to find out
    how many enemies Talis can hit with one fireball. Once you tell
    him the max amount of enemies he can hit, Talis will use his
    wizard energy to feel where the fireball should hit on the
    battlefield.</p>
    <p>In short, you need to calculate the maximum aount of enemies
    Tails can hit with one Fireball.</p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>The input consist of 4 lines. First line containing how many
    enemies there are on the battlefield 0 ≤e ≤100000 Second line
    contains e integers of coordinates of the enemies, seperated by
    spaces. Third line contains how many party-members are on the
    battlefield 0 ≤f ≤100000 Last line contains f integers of
    coordinates of your friends, seperated by spaces.</p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>The output should be one string, that follows this format.
    i1 &gt; i2 outputs: <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$"bigger"$</span> i1 &lt; i2 outputs:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$"smaller"$</span> i1 = i2
    outputs: <span class="tex2jax_process">$"equal"$</span></p>
