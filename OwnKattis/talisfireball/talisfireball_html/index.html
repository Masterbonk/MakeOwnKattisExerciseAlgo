      <h1>Talis’ Fireball</h1>
      <h3>Problem ID: talisfireball</h3>
    </div>
    <p>The battle had been raging for many rounds and your party is
    tired. Things are looking dark, until the wizard Talis realizes
    he has a 3rd level spell slot left. That’s enough for a
    Fireball! But while Talis is searching his scrolls, an arrow
    grazes his glasses. They fall to the ground and shatter into
    pieces. Now you all need to work together to find out how many
    people Talis can hit.<br>
    <br>
    Your team will shout the amount of enemies and their
    coordinates to you. Then they will also shout their location,
    just so Talis doesn’t hit them. Now it is up to you to find out
    how many enemies Talis can hit with one fireball. Once you tell
    him the max amount of enemies he can hit, Talis will use his
    wizard energy to feel where the fireball should hit on the
    battlefield.<br>
    <br>
    In short, you need to calculate the maximum number of enemies
    Tails can hit with one Fireball.<br>
    <br>
    Talis having no situational awareness states multiple rules for
    where he is willing to place the fireball and how big he can
    make it. While the rest of your party holds the enemies at
    bay.<br>
    <br>
    All enemies, allies and the fireball itself will be placed on a
    grid, like shown in the picture. An enemy is considered hit by
    a fireball if the middle of the square is within the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2.5 m$</span> radius circle the
    fireball creates. The fireball cannot hit any ally, or Talis
    will refuse to throw it. Additionally, Talis can only throw the
    fireball so far, so we shall only consider an area of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$450 m * 450 m$</span>.</p>

    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>The input consist of 4 lines. First line containing how many
    enemies there are on the battlefield <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$0 \leq e \leq 100000$</span><br>
    Second line contains e integers of coordinates of the enemies,
    seperated by spaces.<br>
    Third line contains how many party-members are on the
    battlefield <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq f \leq
    100000$</span><br>
    Last line contains f integers of coordinates of your friends,
    seperated by spaces.</p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>Output a single integer giving the maximum number of enemies
    a single fireball can hit at once, without hitting any
    friends.</p>
