Goal: Find continuous subsequences in a given sequence

Method: Have an window(subsequence) to focus on at a time

Sudo-code:
if sum is above 47 -> "remove" first index in window

if sum is below 47 -> include next index

exclude:
current subsequence[:1]

include:
current subsequence +1

Edgecase: index 0 < 0
If the first element in the subsequence is < 0, 
check with and without it
